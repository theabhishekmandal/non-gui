While overriding the equals method, one must also override the hashcode as well.

Repeatedly calling the hashcode method on the same object should return the same result

If two objects are equal, according the equals(Object) method then their hashcode should
also be the same.

If two objects are unequal, then it is not necessary that their hashCode will be different.
However, distinct hashcode improves performance of hash tables.

If a class is immutable and the cost of computing a hash code is significant, you might consider
caching the hash code, rather than recalculating again when requested.

Do not be tempted to exclude significant fields from the hash code com-
putation to improve performance.
