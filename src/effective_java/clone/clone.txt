-   if a class’s clone method returns an instance that is not obtained by call-
    ing super.clone but by calling a constructor(CloneDemoByConstructorCloning.java),
    the compiler won’t complain, but if a subclass of that class calls super.clone,
    the resulting object will have the wrong class,
    preventing the subclass from clone method from working properly
