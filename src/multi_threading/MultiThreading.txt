Why need Threads ?
- Responsiveness
    - Examples of Poor Responsiveness
        - Waiting for Customer Support
        - Late response from a person
        - No feedback from an application
- Performance
    - Doing multiple things at the same time increases throughput
    - Completing a complex task much faster
    - Finish more work in the same period of time
    - For high scale service
        - Fewer machines
        - Less money spent on hardware
        - More money on your pocket

Concurrency vs Parallelism
- Concurrency means doing multiple tasks by a single thread
- Parallelism means doing multiple tasks using multiple threads

Process vs Threads
-   Process can contain multiple Threads
-   Context switching between Process is costlier than Threads

Performance in MultiThreading
-   Latency - The time to completion of a task. Measured in time units.
-   Throughput - The amount of tasks completed in a given period.
