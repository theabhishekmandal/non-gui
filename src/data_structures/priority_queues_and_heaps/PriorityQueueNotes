What is a Priority Queue?
    -   In some situations we may need to find the minimum and maximum element among a collection of
        elements.
    -   We can do this with the help of priority queues
    -   A priority queue is an data structure that supports the operations Insert, DeleteMin(which
        returns and removes the minimum element) and DeleteMax(which returns and removes the maximum element)

    -   These operations are equivalent to EnQueue and DeQueue operations of queue. The difference
        is that, in priority queues, the order in which the elements enter the queue may not be the same
        in which they were processed.

    -   A priority queue is called ascending priority queue when the smallest key has the highest priority
    -   A priority queue is called descending priority queue when the largest key has the highest priority


Main operations of PriorityQueue
    -   Insert(key, data) : Inserts data with key to the priority queue. Elements are ordered based on key.
    -   DeleteMin/DeleteMax : Remove and return the element with smallest/largest key
    -   GetMinimum/GetMaximum : Return the element with the smallest/largest key without deleting it.

Auxiliary operations of Priority Queue
    -   kth Smallest/ kth Largest : Return the kth largest or the kth smallest key in priority queue.
    -   Size : Returns number of elements in priority queue.
    -   HeapSort : Sorts the elements in the priority queue based on priority (key).


Priority Queue Applications
    -   Data compression: Huffman Coding algorithm
    -   Shortest path algorithms: Dijkstra's algorithm
    -   Minimum spanning tree algorithms: Prim's algorithm
    -   Event-driven simulation: customers in line
    -   Selection problem: Finding kth smallest element


Priority Queue Implementations
    -   Unordered Array Implementation
        -   Elements are inserted into the array without bothering about the order.
        -   Deletions are performed by searching the key and then deleting.
        -   Insertions complexity O(1)
        -   Deletions(DeleteMin) complexity O(n)

    -   Ordered Array Implementation
        -   Elements are inserted into the array in sorted order based on key field.
        -   Deletions are performed at only one end.
        -   Insertions complexity O(n)
        -   Deletions(DeleteMin) complexity O(1)

    -   Ordered List Implementation
        -   Elements are inserted into the list in sorted order based on key field
        -   Deletions are performed at only one end hence preserving the status of priority queue
        -   Insertions complexity O(n)
        -   Deletions(DeleteMin) complexity O(1)

    -   Binary Search Tree Implementation
        -   Both insertions and deletions take O(logn) on average if insertions are random

    -   Balanced Binary Search Tree Implementation
        -   Both insertions and deletion take O(logn) in worst case

    -   Binary Heap Implementation
        -   searching takes in O(logn)
        -   Insertions takes in O(logn)
        -   deletions takes in O(logn)
        -   finding the maximum or minimum takes place in O(1)

What is a Heap?
    -   A heap is a tree with some special properties
    -   The special property is that it's value should be <=(Min Heap) or >=(Max Heap) to it's children, this is called heap property
    -   A heap also has a property that all leaves should be at h or h - 1 levels, for some h > 0
    -   It should be a complete binary tree.
    -   Duplicates are allowed in Heap.
    -   It should not be used for searching, but only to find the min/max element.
    -   Height will always be log n.
    -   Insertion should be always in the next free space to maintain the order of complete binary tree.
    -   If there is precomputed array, then use buildHeap to build it which will have complexity O(logn)
    -   If there is one by one insertion, then use single insert, total time taken will be O(n log n).
    -   Deletion of min/max element will take O(log n).
        eg:         1
                   2  3
                 4   5

        In the examples below, the left tree is a heap(each element is greater than its children) and
        the right tree is not a heap(since 11 is greater than 2)

                7                     11
             3     6               5       2
           1   2 4              6    17  14   13

Types of Heaps?
    -   Min heap: The value of a node must be less than or equal to the values of its children
                             11
                         15       12
                      16    17  14    13

    -   Max heap: The value of a node must be greater than or equal to the values of tis children
                             17
                         13       6
                      1     4  2     5

Binary Heaps
    -   In binary heap each node may have to two children. In practice, binary heaps are enough and we
        concentrate on binary min heaps and binary max heaps.

    -   Representing heaps
        -   Heaps can be represented using arrays



Why we should use Binary Heap instead of other implementations?
✅ Binary Heap
Advantages:
🟢 Efficient for priority queue operations (insert, peek, extractMin/extractMax).
🟢 Simple to implement using arrays — no need for pointers or tree balancing.
🟢 Good cache locality due to contiguous memory layout.
🟢 Low constant factors — fewer comparisons than BSTs.
🟢 Widely supported by standard libraries (Java, C++, Python).

Disadvantages:
🔴 No efficient search, update, or delete by arbitrary value (O(n)). Because it supports only the property
    in Min/Max Heap, every node is smaller/greater than its child node, where the actual value will be is not sure. It does not follow
    binary search tree property that left child is smaller and right child is bigger.
🔴 Not suitable for maintaining sorted order or performing range queries.
🔴 Only provides efficient access to either min or max, not both.

✅ Balanced BST (e.g., AVL, Red-Black Tree)
Advantages:

🟢 Maintains full sorted order of elements.
🟢 Allows efficient search, update, and deletion of any element (O(log n)).
🟢 Supports access to both minimum and maximum elements.
🟢 Suitable for range queries and k-th smallest/largest element lookups.
🟢 In-order traversal is possible for sorted output.

Disadvantages:

🔴 More complex to implement — requires rotations, rebalancing, and pointers.
🔴 Higher constant factors than heaps for basic priority queue operations.
🔴 Poor cache locality due to non-contiguous memory (pointers).
