/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/swim-in-rising-water/description/
 * Why do we use a PriorityQueue and return the maximum elevation?
 *
 * Problem Summary:
 * ----------------
 * - Each cell in the grid has a unique elevation.
 * - You start at (0, 0) and want to reach (n-1, n-1) as early as possible.
 * - At time t, you can enter a cell if its elevation <= t.
 * - You can move in four directions: up, down, left, right.
 *
 * PriorityQueue Usage:
 * --------------------
 * - We use a Min Heap (PriorityQueue) to always pick the next cell with the
 *   lowest elevation we can step into.
 * - This ensures we explore the least "costly" (in terms of elevation) path first.
 * - This behavior is similar to Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path.
 *
 * Why Return Maximum Elevation in Path:
 * -------------------------------------
 * - The "cost" of a path from (0,0) to (n-1,n-1) is determined by the highest
 *   elevation along that path.
 * - You can only step into a cell when the water level (time) reaches at least
 *   that elevation.
 * - Therefore, to reach the destination at the earliest time, you need to find
 *   the path from start to end where the highest elevation is minimized.
 *
 * - We track the maximum elevation along the current path using:
 *      max = Math.max(max, currentCellElevation);
 *
 * - Once we reach the destination, this 'max' will be the minimum time required
 *   to swim from start to end.
 *
 * Time and Space Complexity:
 * --------------------------
 * - Time Complexity: O(n^2 * log n), each of the n^2 cells is added to the priority
 *   queue once and heap operations take O(log n^2) = O(log n).
 *
 * - Space Complexity: O(n^2), for visited matrix and priority queue.
