/**
 * What is inherited in Java Inheritance.
 * -    sub-class inherits all the public, protected and default
 *      (Only if the sub-class is located in the same package as the super class) methods and fields of the super class.
 *
 * What is not inherited in Java Inheritance.
 * -    Private fields and methods of the super class are not inherited by the sub-class and canâ€™t be accessed directly by the subclass.
 *      Constructors of the super-class are not inherited.
 *
 * -    There is a concept of constructor chaining in Java which determines in what order constructors are called in case of inheritance.
 *
 * -    Also, can only expand the access modifier of the overridden method from super class to sub class. Eg: can go from default to protected
 *      but not private
